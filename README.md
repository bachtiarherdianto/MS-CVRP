This repository is related to the **Guided Multiple Search (MS) metaheuristic algorithm** presented in our preprint manuscript _Feature-Guided Metaheuristic with Diversity Management for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem._, which has now been accepted for publication in the **European Journal of Operational Research (EJOR)**.

The full source code will be released in a future update. Additional time is currently needed to further prepare, clean, and organize the code so that it is well documented.

If you have any questions or would like to receive updates regarding the code release, please feel free to contact me at bachtiarherdianto@gmail.com

Thank you for your interest and understanding.
